# **Minimal Change Disease (MCD)** 
## **OverView**
 * Previously known as lipiod Nephrosis, nil disease, and minimal change nephropathy
 * Podocytopathy most commenly seen in children; seen with 10-25% of Adults with Nephrotic syndrome
 * Steroid responsiveness demonstrates good long term prognosis
 * Adults typically have slower response than children
 * Relapses infrequent after remission, Up to 33% of patients will be frequent relapsers (11-29%), or steroid dependent (14-30%) 
## **Pathophysiology** 
 * Pathogensis currently unclear; however, it is thought that T-cell dysregululation may play a part in podocyte injury. Improvement with B cell-depleting medications support a role for B cells as well
 * Pathology: Podocyte foot process effacement on LM and EM
 * In adults MCD may be superimposed on pre-existing chronic lesions
 * Antibiodies to Nephrine may be associated with podocyte injury in MCD and FSGS, though still under study at this time
## **Clinical Presentation**
 * Nephrotic range proteinuria --> typically large amount of protein in urine, in the range of 10g/g
 * Signs of Volume overload. (e.g lower extremty edema, peri-orbital edema, ect.)
 * Hypoalbuminemia
 * Hypercholesterolemia
 * AKI on presentation frequently
## **Definitions of Treatment Response**
 * Complete remission
 * 
 * Partial Remission
 * Relapse
 * Steroid-resistant
 * Frequent Reelapsing
 * Steroid-dependent
