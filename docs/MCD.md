# **Minimal Change Disease (MCD)** 
## **OverView**
 * Previously known as lipiod Nephrosis, nil disease, and minimal change nephropathy
 * Podocytopathy most commenly seen in children; seen with 10-25% of Adults with Nephrotic syndrome
 * Steroid responsiveness demonstrates good long term prognosis
 * Adults typically have slower response than children
 * Relapses infrequent after remission, Up to 33% of patients will be frequent relapsers (11-29%), or steroid dependent (14-30%) 
## **Pathophysiology** 
 * Pathogensis currently unclear; however, it is thought that T-cell dysregululation may play a part in podocyte injury. Improvement with B cell-depleting medications support a role for B cells as well
 * Pathology: Podocyte foot process effacement on LM and EM
 * In adults MCD may be superimposed on pre-existing chronic lesions
 * Antibiodies to Nephrine may be associated with podocyte injury in MCD and FSGS, though still under study at this time
## **Clinical Presentation**
 * Nephrotic range proteinuria --> typically large amount of protein in urine, in the range of 10g/g
 * Signs of Volume overload. (e.g lower extremty edema, peri-orbital edema, ect.)
 * Hypoalbuminemia
 * Hypercholesterolemia
 * AKI on presentation frequently
## **Definitions of Treatment Response**
 * Complete remission
    1. Reduction of proteinuria to <0.3g/d or PCR <300mg/g, stable serum creatine and serum albumin >3.5g/dl
 * Partial Remission
    1. Reduction of proteinuria to <0.3-3.5g/d or PCR <300-3500mg/g, and a decrease >50% from baseline
 * Relapse
    1. Proteinuria >3.5/d or PCR >3500mg/g after complete remission has been achieved
 * Steroid-resistant\
    1. Reduction of proteinuria to >3.5/d or PCR >3500mg/g, with <50% from baseline despite prednisone 1mg/kg/day or 2mg/kg every other day for >16weeks
 * Frequent Reelapsing
    1. Two or more relapses per 6 months (or four or more relapses per 12months)
 * Steroid-dependent
    1. Relapsing occuring during, or w/in two weeks of completing glucocorticoid therapy
