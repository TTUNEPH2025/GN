# **Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis (ANCA)**
## **Overview**
  * Small vesculitis: necrotizine inflammation of small vessels and little to no deposition of immune complexes (pauci-immune)
  * Four forms of disease presentation
    1. Renal Limitted Vasculitis (RLV): pauci-immune Crescent GN
    2. Microscopic Polyangitis (MPA): Vasculitis w/no asthma or ganulomas
    3. Granulomatosis w/polyangitis (GPA): Granulomas and no astman
    4. Eosinophilic GPA: eosinophilia, athma, and granulomas
  * Two autoantibodies PR3-ANCA (proteinase 3) and MPO-ANCA (myeloperodixase)
    1. Both positive simultaneously consider Drug induced
    2. PR3-ANCA positive patients have higher relapse rate than MPO-ANCA positive patients
  * Negative ANCA serology does not exclude diagnosis
  * 90% of patient have crescents on kidney biopsy
  * Poor prognosis w/out immunosuppressive therapy
  * ANCA titers should not guide treatment
  * Can recur after kidney transplant
  * Need to have complete clinical remission for 6 months or more pior to kidney transplant
## **Pathophysiology**
  * PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA
    1. Both cause same sprectrum of diasea
    2. Organ system distribution.......
## **Clinical Presentation**
  * Persistent Hematuria and proteinuria seen in 50% of patients after treatment
