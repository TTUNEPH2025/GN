# **Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis (ANCA)**
## **Overview**
  * Occurs most often in older patietn's 50 years and older
  * Has ongoing acute injury until complete remission is achieved
  * Four forms of disease presentation: Renal limitted, MPA, GPA, and EGPA
  * Two autoantibodies: PR3-ANCA (proteinase 3) and MPO-ANCA (myeloperodixase)
  * 90% of patient have crescents on kidney biopsy
  * Poor prognosis w/out immunosuppressive therapy
  * ANCA titers should not guide treatment
  * Can recur after kidney transplant
  * Need to have complete clinical remission for 6 months or more pior to kidney transplant
## **Pathophysiology**
  * Small vesculitis: necrotizine inflammation of small vessels and little to no deposition of immune complexes (pauci-immune)
  * Four forms of disease presentation
    1. Renal Limitted Vasculitis (RLV): pauci-immune Crescent GN
    2. Microscopic Polyangitis (MPA): Vasculitis w/no asthma or ganulomas
    3. Granulomatosis w/polyangitis (GPA): Granulomas and no astman
    4. Eosinophilic GPA: eosinophilia, athma, and granulomas
  * Autoantibodies: PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA
    1. Both cause same sprectrum of diasea
    2. Organ system distribution and pathologic patterns differ by Antigen specificity
    3. PR3-ANCA more associated with lung involvement
    4. MPO-ANC more associated w/renal limitted involvement
    5. Duel positive patient's consider drug induced ANCA disease
    6. PR3-ANCA positive patients higher relapse rate than MPO-ANCA positive patients
  * Histologic activity unlikely in the abscense of hematuria
    1. Patient's with hematuria more likely to relapse than those w/out, but difference in occurance of kidney failure
  * Four histologic Classes
    1. Focal: 50% or more glomeruli normal 
    2. Crescentic: 50% or more glomerulic have cellular cresents
    3. Sclerotic: 50% or more glomeruli globally sclerotic
    4. Mixed: does not fit any of the above classifications
### Cresentic GN
 * Cresents are etiologically and pathogenically a nonspecific response to glomerular capilary rupture that is typically caused by inflammmatory injury
 * Types: Cellular, fibrocellular, fibrous, and pseudocrescent
   1. Higher number of fibrous cresents present on biopsy--> less likely to have recovery
 * Cresentic lesions can be found on wide range of GN with varying percentages of glomerulus
 * Anti-GBM and ANCA vasculitis are considered "rapidly progressive cresentic gn". Both of which are typically severe and agressive with greater than 50% Crescents found on light microscopy
## **Clinical Presentation**
  * Signs and Symptoms of Vasculitis
    1. Nasal, sinus, and ear disease: sinus pain, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal obstruction, purulent/bloody nasal discharge, etc
    2. Airway and lung involvement: cough, hemoptsys (alveolar hemorrhage), dyspnea, and pleuritic pain
    4. Skin: purpura, possible focal necrosis and ulceration, etc
    5. Eyes: conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, retinal vasculitis, uvitis, etc
    6. CNS: mononeuropathy, scranial nerve abnormalitis, sensorineural hearing loss, meningeal disease, etc
  * Renal manifestation
    1. Microscopic hematuria w/dysmorphic RBC
    2. Rapidly declining eGFR
    3. Proteinuria
    4. Persistent Hematuria and proteinuria seen in 50% of patients after treatment
## **Drugs and Diseases Associated with ANCA**
  * Drugs
    1. Hydralazine (frequently high titers of MPO)
    2. Prophylthiouracil (frequently MPO positive)
    3. Minocycline
    4. Cocaine and levamisole (associated with duel positivity with PR3 and MPO)
  * Subacute bacterial endocarditis and other forms of chronic bacteremia demonstrated positivity for ANCA
  * ANCA positivity seening 60-80% of UC patients and patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis
## **Deffinitions of Treatment Response**
  * Disease activity
    1. ANCA-associated vasculitis represented in sings or symtpoms oattributable to active disease in any organ system
  * Remission
    1. The abscense of manifestation of vasculitis and GN
    2. GN: stable or improved eGFR while <ins>hematuria and proteinuria are present at time of active disease and can resolve completely, their persistence does not necessarily imply active disease </ins>
  * Relapse
    1. occurrence of increased disease activity after a period of partial or complete remission
    2. Return or increase of hematuria w/proteinuria may indicate relapse
    3. Major replase: life or organ threating disease (examples include diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, subglottic stenosis, GN, or vascultitis threatening vision)
  * Treatment-resistent Disease
    1. Persistence of or appearance of kidney and/or systemic manifestation of vasculitis, while recieving treatment equal in intensity to induction therapy
  * Factors that increase risk of relapse
    1. Diagnosis of GPA
    2. PR3-ANCA
    3. Lower Serum Cr
    4. More extensive disease
    5. Ear, nose, and throat disease
    6. History of relapse
    7. ANCA positive at end of induction/Rise in ANCA
    8. Lower cyclophosphamide exposure
    9. Immunosuppressive therapy w/drawal
    10. Glucocorticoid w/drawl
