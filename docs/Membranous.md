# **Membranous Nephropathy (MN)**
## **Overview**
* Occurs in all ages, but most common in ages 30-60 years old
* Male:Female ratio 2:1
* Risk factors for progression: Male, >60 years of age, high levels of proteinuria, and elevated Cr levels
* Primary MN about 70% of cases, Secondaary about 30%
* PLA2R antigen is most comming antigen in Primary MN
* Secondary MN: Autoimmune/CVD, Drug associated, Infection related, Malignancy
    1. Children < 16 years of age commonly: SLE, HBV, congenital syphilis
    2. Adults > 60 years of age commonly: Drug associated and Malignancy
* Biopsy not required for diagnosis PLA2R positive Primary MN
* Spontaneous Remission Relatively common (about 30% of Cases)
* Transplant
    1. occurs most frequently ~2 years post transplant
    2. Is most commonly sub nephrotic 
## **Pathophysiology**
 * Pathology: Subepithelial deposits
    1. Immuncomplex formation in situ of the subepitheial layers of the basement membrane
    2. IgG granulated pattern on IF
    3. Well seen in EM and IF
    4. Spike formation and thickened Basement membrane 
 * Rarely Crescents --> if present should test instigate further testing: ANCA, ANA, Anti-GMB
 * Primary MN Antigen association
   1. PLA2R: Most commen antigen/anti-body in Primary MN, anti-body testing excellent correleatio w/5-10 excess compaired to tissue staining
   2. THSD7A: No antibody testing available at this time
 * Secondary  
## **Clinical Presentation**
## **Drugs and Diseases Associated with Membranous**
## **Deffinitions of Treatment Response**
## **Treatment**
* It is reasonable to wait 6 months, while patient is on maximal anti-proteinuric therapy, before starting immunosupressive therapy due to high rates of spontaneous remission.
* PLA2R-ab testing with ELIZA and/or IFA is cleared by FDA for aid in diagnosis only. Use for PLA2R-ab testing in monitoring is off lable use, though used extensively in guidline recomendations
* Prerequisites for Noninvasive testing
    1. Proteinuria
    2. Preserved eGFR (>60)
    3. Absense of Diabetes or other conditions traditionally associated with MN
    4. Clearly positive PLA2R-ab tested by ELIZA or IFA --> Best if can use both for non-invasive testing
