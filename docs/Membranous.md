# **Membranous Nephropathy (MN)**
## **Overview**
* Occurs in all ages, but most common in ages 30-60 years old
* Male:Female ratio 2:1
* Risk factors for progression: Male, >60 years of age, high levels of proteinuria, and elevated Cr levels
* Primary MN about 70% of cases, Secondaary about 30%
* PLA2R antigen is most comming antigen in Primary MN
* Secondary MN: Autoimmune/CVD, Drug associated, Infection related, Malignancy
    1. Children < 16 years of age commonly: SLE, HBV, congenital syphilis
    2. Adults > 60 years of age commonly: Drug associated and Malignancy
* Biopsy not required for diagnosis PLA2R positive Primary MN
* Spontaneous Remission Relatively common (about 30% of Cases)
* Transplant
    1. occurs most frequently ~2 years post transplant
    2. Is most commonly sub nephrotic 
## **Pathophysiology**
 * Rarely Crescents --> if present should test instigate further testing: ANCA, ANA, Anti-GMB
