# **Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN)/Immunoglobulin A Vasculitis (IgAV)**
## **Overview**
 * IgAN
      1. Glomerular Disease w/co-dominant IgA Glomerular staining
      2. Three types: Primary, Secondary, and Systemic forms (IgA Vasculitis)
      3. Most commen pattern of primary glomerular disease world wide
      4. Most prevalent in people of East Asian ancestry followed by Caucasians
      5. Mest-C Score: Risk tool/score provide earlier risk predicition in IgAN
 * IgA Vasculitis
      1. IgA autoantibodies deposition in the vessels
      2. Children < 16 years of age, often self limitting
      3. Glomerular disease 30% children, 60% Adults
      4. Worse GN in children, worse outcomes in Adults
      5. Adults typicaly more severe and relapsing disease
## **Pathophysiology**
 * IgAN
      1. GN with co-dominant IgA glomerular staining with IgA deposistion in the Mesangial +/- Capillary
      2. IgG typically also presented along with C3
      3. 4 HIT Model
         - Production of poorly glycosylated IgA1 (Gd-Ig-A1)
         - Production Anti-Gd-IgA1 autoantibodies (anti-Gd-IgA1 autoantibodies)
         - Formation of Glomerular deposition of Immuncomplexes
         - Deposition of circulating immunce complexes --> Mesangial, Podocyte, Endothelial inducingc cytokine release, compliment activation, and inflammation causing injury
    4. Acute Lesion
         - Mesangial Hypercellularity
         - Endocapillary Hypercellularity
         - Crescent
         - FSGS and podocytopathy
     5. Chronic lesions: corelate with outcome
        - IFTA
        - FSGS
        - Global Sclerosis
        - Arteriosclerosis
 * Mest-C
      1. T score: Most Consistent predictor of Renal Survival
      2. M1, S1, T1/2: Worse outcomes, Regardless of Immunosupression status
      3. E1 and C1: Poor out comes in patient not treated w/Immunosupression
      4. C2: Predicitive of poor outcomes regardless of Immunosupression (not synonymous w/RPGN)
      5. S1 w/podocytopathy: heavier proteinuria and Rapid eGFR loss --> Better response to steroids 
 * IgAV
      1. Systemic vasculities IgA1-dominant deposits
      2. IgA autoantibodies desposition in the small vessels affecting: skin, joints, intestines, and kidney (rarely affects lungs and CNS)
## **Clinical Presentation**
 * Hematuria
 * Proteinuria
 * Edema
 * HTN
## **Diseases Associated with IgAN/IgAV**
* Diseases
  1. Cirrhosis
  2. Portal HTN
  3. Inflammatory Bowel Disease
  4. Celiac
  5. Dermatits Herpetiformis
  6. Psoriasis
* Infections
  1. HIV
  2. TB
  3. Brucellosis
  4. Lerosy
