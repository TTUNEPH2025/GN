# **Infectious Screening**
* Screening should be based on indepented exposures based on patient history, geographic region, and occupations
* Exhaustive list not provided; However, several infectious disease that may have benefit to screening prior to initiation of immunosupression are as follows:
  1. Syphilis
  2. HIV
  3. Hepatitis B (HBV) --> if not treated prior to initiation of steroids or cytotix/immunomodulating agents can induce serious exacerbation of HBV replication and aggravate liver disease
  4. Hepatitis C (HCV)
  5. Quantiferon for TB screening
  6. Strongyloides Stercoralix for at risk individuals --> asymptomatic infection has potential to transform into lethal systemic disease after exposure to steroid therapy
# **Cancer Screening**
* Risk of bladder cancer (and other cancers) is greater if the cumulative dose of cyclophosphamid exceeds 36g (about 500mg/kg in adults) in a patient's life time. Yearly urologic screening is recommended in high-risk individuals
### Age specific malignancy screening. (small list of the following common screening cancers, not comprenhensive) 
    1. Breast Cancer
       * Women age 40-45 annual mammograms as patient wishes
       * Women age 45-54 annual mammograms
       * Women age 55 and older mammograms every two years
    2. Colon Cancer
       * Screening age 45-75
       * Ages 76-85 Screening as indicated
       * No screening need past age 85
     3. Cervical Cancer
       * Screening age 25-65 with PAP w/HPV every 5 years or PAP every 3 years
     4. Lung Cancer
       * Low Dose CT scan 50-80 years old if smoking or used to smoke, and 20 pack year history
     5. Prostate
       * Start screening with PSA at 50 years old
## Annual Dermatology exam
# **Other**
* DEXA
  * KDIGO: recommended individual fracture risk assessment/bone mineral diase for prolonged steroid use
  * USPSTF: women over 65 years old and postmenopausal women youner than 65 with one or more risk factors for osteoporosis
  * Neither guidline give direct recommendations on time of DEXA scan need in setting of long term steroids though general consensus that prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids causes bone loss
