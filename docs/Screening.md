## **Infectious Screening**
* Screening should be based on indepented exposures based on patient history, geographic region, and occupations
* Exhaustive list not provided; However, several infectious disease that may have benefit to screening prior to initiation of immunosupression are as follows:
    1. Syphilis
    2. HIV
    3. Hepatitis B (HBV) --> if not treated prior to initiation of steroids or cytotix/immunomodulating agents can induce serious exacerbation of HBV replication and aggravate liver disease
    4. Hepatitis C (HCV)
    5. Quantiferon for TB screening
    6. Strongyloides Stercoralix for at risk individuals --> asymptomatic infection has potential to transform into lethal systemic disease after exposure to steroid therapy
## **Cancer Screening**
 * Risk of bladder cancer (and other cancers) is greater if the cumulative dose of cyclophosphamid exceeds 36g (about 500mg/kg in adults) in a patient's life time. Yearly urologic screening is recommended in high-risk individuals
 * Annual Dermatology exam
### Age specific malignancy screening
* List of common malignancy screening, not comprenhensive, is as follows:
 * Breast Cancer
    1. Women age 40-45 annual mammograms as patient wishes
    2. Women age 45-54 annual mammograms
    3. Women age 55 and older mammograms every two years
 * Colon Cancer
    1. Screening age 45-75
    2. Ages 76-85 Screening as indicated
    3. No screening need past age 85
 * Cervical Cancer
    1. Screening age 25-65 with PAP w/HPV every 5 years or PAP every 3 years
 * Lung Cancer
    1. Low Dose CT scan 50-80 years old if smoking or used to smoke, and 20 pack year history
 * Prostate
    1.  Start screening with PSA at 50 years old
## **Other**
* DEXA
    1. KDIGO: recommended individual fracture risk assessment/bone mineral diase for prolonged steroid use
    2. USPSTF: women over 65 years old and postmenopausal women youner than 65 with one or more risk factors for osteoporosis
    3. Neither guidline give direct recommendations on time of DEXA scan need in setting of long term steroids though general consensus that prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids causes bone loss
* Recommend pregancy testing for female patients of child bearing age prior to initation of most immunosupression medications
