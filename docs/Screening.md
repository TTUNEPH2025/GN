## **Infectious Screening**
* Screening should be based on indepented exposures based on patient history, geographic region, and occupations
* Exhaustive list not provided; However, several infectious disease that may have benefit to screening prior to initiation of immunosupression are as follows:
  * Syphilis
  * HIV
  * Hepatitis B (HBV) --> if not treated prior to initiation of steroids or cytotix/immunomodulating agents can induce serious exacerbation of HBV replication and aggravate liver disease
  * Hepatitis C (HCV)
  * Quantiferon for TB screening
  * Strongyloides Stercoralix for at risk individuals --> asymptomatic infection has potential to transform into lethal systemic disease after exposure to steroid therapy
## **Cancer Screening**
* Risk of bladder cancer (and other cancers) is greater if the cumulative dose of cyclophosphamid exceeds 36g (about 500mg/kg in adults) in a patient's life time. Yearly urologic screening is recommended in high-risk individuals
* Age specific malignancy screening
* Annual Dermatology exam
* DEXA
  * KDIGO: recommended individual fracture risk assessment/bone mineral diase for prolonged steroid use
  * USPSTF: women over 65 years old and postmenopausal women youner than 65 with one or more risk factors for osteoporosis
  * Neither guidlines give direct recommendations on time of DEXA scan need in setting of long term steroids though co
