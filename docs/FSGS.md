# **Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)** 
## **OverView**
  * Most common cause of Nephrotic syndrome in U.S.
  * 3 types: Idiopathic, Secondary, and Genetic
  * Idioppathic can reoccure in  Transplant patients (typically rapid coures in the first months)
  * Patient's with APOL1 varient: increase incidence of FSGS typical lesions and collapsing lesions 
## **Pathophysiology** 
  * Primary: Circulating Permeability factors yet to identified
     1. Pathology: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and foot process effacement (may be duffuse or variable)
     2. Reoccurs in transplant patients
     3. Responds to Plasmapheresis in transplant patient
  * Secondary: has a known cause
     1. Pathology: FSGS lesions, with or without  foot process effacement
     2. Adaptive changes to glomerular hyperfiltration typicallly in the setting of reduced nephron mass (low birth weight, reflux nephropathy, renal dysplasia secondary to other renal disease)
     3. Direct podocyt injury: HIV, Parvo, ect. 
  * Genetic
     1. Mutations in podocyte or glomular basement membrane
     2. Not routinely tested in adults
     3. Should be considered in adults resistent to steroid therapy
     4. Patient's with APOL1 are more susceptible to develop these lesions
  * MCD vs FSGS
     1. Both have foot process effacement
     2. FSGS: presence of segmental sclerosis and early findings demonstrate tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerular hypertrophy 
  * Circulating factors currently under investigation for primary FSGS
     1. Anti-Nephrin Ab
     2. SuPAR (not specific  for FSGS)
     3. Cardiotropphine-like cytokine 
## **Clinical Presentation**
  * Proteniuria > 3.5g/d
  * Hypoalbuminemia <30g/L
  * Dyslipidemia
  * Edema/signs of volume overload
## **Drugs and Disease Associated with FSGS**
  * Infectious
    1. HIV
    2. Parvo B19
    3. CMV
    4. COVID 19
  * Adapative
    1. Low nephron mass (low birth weight, surgical removal)
    2. Obesity 
    3. Remnant kidney
    4. Diabetic Nephropahty
    5. Reflux Nephropathy
    6. Oligomeganephronia
  * Drugs
    1. Interferon
    2. Pamidronate
    3. anabolic steroids
    4. CNI
    5. NSAIDs
    6. Lithium
    7. DAAV (direct acting anti-viral)
    8. mTORs
    9. Heroin
## **Definitions of Treatment Response**
  * Complete remission
     1. Reduction of proteinuria to <0.3g/d or PCR <300mg/d (or 30mg/mmol)
     2. Stable serume Creatinine
     3. Serum albumin >3.5 g/dL (or 35g/L)
  * Partial REmission
     1. Reduction of proteinuria to 0.3-3.5g/d or PCR 300-3500mg/g (or 30-350mg/mmol)
     2. decrease >50% from baseline
  * Relapse
     1. Proteinuria of >3.5g/d or PCR >3500mg/d (or 350mg/mmol) after complete remission achieved
     2. Increase in proteinuria by >50% during partial remission
  * Steroid-resistand FSGS
     1. Persistence of proteinuria >3.5g/d or PCR >3500mg/d (or 350mg/mmol) w/<50% reduction from baseline despite adequate dosing of prednisone for at least 16 wks
  * Steroid-dependent FSGS
    1. Relapse occuring during or w/in 2wk of completing glucocorticoid therapy
  * CNI-resistent FSGS
    1. Persistence of proteinuria >3.5g/d or PCR >3500mg/d (or 350mg/mmol) w/<50% reduction from baseline despite treatment with cyclosporine/tacrolimus with trough levels at goal ranges
  * CNI-dependent FSGS
    1. Relapse occuring during or w/in 2wks of completeing cyclosporine/tacrolimus therapy for >12mo
