# **Infection Related Glomerulonephritis (IRGN)**
## **Overview**
  * Typically adults have worse outcomes than children
  * In adults comorbidities are common and include conditions that pre-disposed to infection
    1. Diabetes frequently in the US
    2. Alcoholism (more common in europe)
    3. Malignancy
    4. IV drug use
    5. Synthetic heart valves
  * Diabetics with diabetic npehropathy typically have poor renal prognosis
  * Strep and staph make up about 12-24%
  * Gram negative about 10% of infections
  * Not all infections are clinically evident in abotu 10-20% of patients (in US and Europe)
  * Post-Streptoccal GN
    1. Typicallly children and young adults
    2. Male:female --> 2-3:1
    3. Most common acute GN infection in children and much high incidence in rscourse limited countries
    4. Has a latency period of 10-21 days before eficend of GN
    5. Recurrence rare
    6. Prognosis: typically all improve
## **Pathophysiology**
## **Clinical Presentation**
    * Hematuria (microscopic or gross)
  * AKI
  * Proteinuria
  * Edema
  * New onset/worsening HTN
  * Can have positive serologies of: ANCA and ANA with low C3/C4
  * Fevers, arthalgia, malaise
  * Post-Streptoccal GN
    1. Nephritic syndrome typically last less than 2 weeks
    2. C3 normalizes in about 6-8wk --> hypocomplementima lasting about >2-3months on is an indication for biopsy
    3. Hematuria typically resolves by about 6 months
## **Infections commonly assoicated with IRGN**
  * Endocarditis GN
    1. Staphyloccus aureus
    2. Streptococcal
    3. Bartoonella hensele, Coxiella burnetti (Q fever); These typically very difficult to grow from Blood culture
