# **Infection Related Glomerulonephritis (IRGN)**
## **Overview**
  * Typically adults have worse outcomes than children
  * In adults comorbidities are common and include conditions that pre-disposed to infection
    1. Diabetes frequently in the US
    2. Alcoholism (more common in europe)
    3. Malignancy
    4. IV drug use
    5. Synthetic heart valves
  * Diabetics with diabetic npehropathy typically have poor renal prognosis
  * Strep and staph make up about 12-24%
  * Gram negative about 10% of infections
  * Not all infections are clinically evident in abotu 10-20% of patients (in US and Europe)
  * Post-Streptoccal GN
    1. Typicallly children and young adults
    2. Male:female --> 2-3:1
    3. Most common acute GN infection in children and much high incidence in rscourse limited countries
    4. Has a latency period of 10-21 days before eficend of GN
    5. Recurrence rare
    6. Prognosis: typically all improve
## **Pathophysiology**
  * Multiple histologic patterns seend
    1. Mesangial proliferative  (often found in resolving injury)
    2. Focal Proliferative
    3. Diffuse proliferative
    4. Necrotizing and Crescentic GN: common with intravascular infection espically endocarditis
    5. MPGN: consider Shunt nephritis(Immune complex nephritis as a complication of chronic infection from ventriculoatrial shunt, ventriculojuglar shunt, ventriculoperitoneal shunt), endocarditis, parasitic --> often IgM dominent and a chronic infection
  * Incluse Criteria: need 3 out of 5
    1. Clinical or lab evidence of infection
    2. Low Serum C3
    3. Exudative GN
    4. C3 dominent or co-dominent on IF (Immunofluorescents)
    5. Hump-shaped subepithelial on EM (Electron Microscopy)
  * Post-Streptoccal GN
    1. typically low C3 levels in ~90% of patients
    2. Throat or skin culture positive in about 25% of cass
    3. Pathophysiology: SPEB (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B) --> can be found in humplike deposites; NAPLr (nephritis associated plasmin Receptor) may activate C3; Transient anti-factor B likely promots activation of all three complement pathways
    4. Path
       * LM: diffuse proliferation, exudative wiht PMN
       * IF: C3 dominant or co-dominant staining (stary sky, garland pattern)
       * EM: subendothelial humps and small supendothelial deposite
## **Clinical Presentation**
  * Hematuria (microscopic or gross)
  * AKI
  * Proteinuria
  * Edema
  * New onset/worsening HTN
  * Can have positive serologies of: ANCA and ANA with low C3/C4
  * Fevers, arthalgia, malaise
  * Post-Streptoccal GN
    1. Nephritic syndrome typically last less than 2 weeks
    2. C3 normalizes in about 6-8wk --> hypocomplementima lasting about >2-3months on is an indication for biopsy
    3. Hematuria typically resolves by about 6 months
## **Infections commonly assoicated with IRGN**
  * Streptococcal infections about 28-47%
  * Staphylococcus aureus or staphlococcus epidermidis around 12-24% of cases
  * Gram negative about 22% of cases
  * Endocarditis GN
    1. Staphyloccus aureus
    2. Streptococcal
    3. Bartoonella hensele, Coxiella burnetti (Q fever); These typically very difficult to grow from Blood culture
  * Viral and Parasitic infection
    1. HCV, HBV, and HIV --> known cause of virally meditated GN
    2. Malaria, Schistosomaiasis, mycoplasma, leishmaniasis, filariasis, histoplasmosis
## **Treatment**
  * Treat underlying infection
  * General supportive care for kidney injury
  * Immunosupresion generally not advised
  * HBV: pegylated interferon regimens should not be used to treate patients with replicative HBV infection and GN --> can aggravate autoimmune phenomenia and as there are newer antiviral regimens that are effective IFN-alpha-based regimens should be avoided
  * Plasma exchange may be tried in patient with accompaning cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in related to hepatitis infections
  * Recommend to assess for viral coinfections in patient's supspected to have schistosomal GN
  * Recommend treating HIV regardless of CD4 count in setting of HIVAN
