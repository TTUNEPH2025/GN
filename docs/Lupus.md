## **Overview**
  * 6 Classes
      1. Minimal Mesangial LN
      2. Mesangial Proliferative LN
      3. Focal LN (< 50% of glomeruli)
      4. Diffuse LN (≥ 50% of glomeruli)
      5. Membranouse Lupus
      6. Advanced Sclerosing LN (≥ 90% global sclerosied glomeruli)
  * Can have mixed classes of LN
  * LN rare disease (20-60% of SLE cases)

  * Childhood onset of SLE is a ssociated wtih increased risk of LN and more severe disease
## **Pathophysiology**
  * TMA
    1. Causes most revelant to LN: TTP, Antiphospholipid, and compliment medicated diesease
    2. can occure due to shiga-toxin-HUS, Infections, drugs, or malignancies
